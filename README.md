Enviro Clock – ARM Based Embedded System
Description

Enviro Clock is an ARM-based embedded system that integrates a Real-Time Clock (RTC) with environmental monitoring using a temperature sensor (LM35). The project demonstrates embedded C programming, peripheral interfacing, and real-time data acquisition.
Hardware Used

    ARM Microcontroller
